# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical problems faced by telecom companies. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using **machine learning models** and presenting insights through an **interactive dashboard and web application**.

The project includes:
- End-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Multiple ML model training and comparison
- **Live prediction web app**
- **Live analytics dashboard**

---
## 🚀 Live Deployment
The project is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing both prediction and analytics capabilities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and service usage
- Identify factors responsible for customer churn
- Build and evaluate multiple ML models
- Predict whether a customer will churn or not
- Provide business insights through dashboards

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

📌 **Random Forest** achieved the best overall performance and was selected for deployment.
